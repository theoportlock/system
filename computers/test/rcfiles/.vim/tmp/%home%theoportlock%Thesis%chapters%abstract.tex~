\chapter{Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Theory}
\section{Magnets, how do they work?}
Each nuclei have magnetism
when placed in magnetic field they will line up with that field
nuclei have angular momentum (wheel on string analogy)
\subsection{Magnetic moments}
\section{Larmor Precession and Resonance}
Certain nuclei often with a spin of a half will exhibit a magnetic moment that can be measured by NMR (first identified in 1946)
The resonance of nuclear magnets was first identified
apply the torque perpendicular to the field and movement at the precession frequency is called resonance
boltzmann factor
\section{Chemical Shift}
chemical shift stuff etc
\subsection{Spin Coupling}
\subsection{Relaxation, Nuclear Overhauser Effect, and chemical exchange}
